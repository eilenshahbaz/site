        <p>Eilen is a young, motivated entrepreneur. Often referred to as the Tony Stark of the web by his peers. He comes from
          humble beginnings: a son of two immigrant parents who brought their children to the United States in 2007 to provide
          a better future for them.</p>

        <h3>Art</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">At merely 4 years of age, my father put a brush in my left hand and a canvas in the other and said, "Son, the world
          is but an oyster to your imagination. It's up to you to find the pearls. Throw all the paint you can at it." I
          retorted, "Papa, I don't speak English yet." The following was the result of my groundbreaking work that would
          go on to revertebrate the art industry and usher in a century of post-neo-surrealism era.</p>

          <p>"The best way to describe Eilen is as a religious experience. Genius is not replicable. Inspiration, though, is
            contagious, and multiform — and even just to see, close up, power and fortitude made vulnerable to beauty is
            to feel inspired and (in a fleeting, mortal way) reconciled."</p>
